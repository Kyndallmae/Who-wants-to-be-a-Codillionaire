## Who Wants to be a Codillionaire!
This game is a take on "Who wants to be a Codillionaire" but you are answering questions related to coding.  

# Description
This app was created as a game to help coding students study. For every answer you get correct, you get a point. For every answer you get incorrect, you lose time from the timer. You answer as many questions as you can before the timer runs out.

# How to use
When you first see the page, you press start and the timer begins. The first question pops up and you need to pick between four answer options. After you pick an answer, you click next to see the next answer. After time runs out you may save your score with your initials for later viewing.
