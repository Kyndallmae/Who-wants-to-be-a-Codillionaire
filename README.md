This is a coding quiz game, cerated to help you review the materials we have learned in class!

## About
I was given a README file only and was required to build an interactive coding quiz from scratch. This game helps you review the content we have learned in class. The timer will start when you push start and you have 30 seconds to answer all four questions. Selecting the right answer allows you to move on, whereas selecting the incorrect answer, you may move on but 5 seconds is deducted from the timer. They game is over when you answer all questions or the time runs out. You are also able to view high scores and input your initials for your score. 

## Challenges Faced
I faced a lot of challenges with this assignment. I struggled with creating the timer and mkaing the questions appear. This assignment is incomplete, but I will be meeting with a tutor to finish it.
